# Tester Program

This Program is for checking written codes with special inputs with their outputs 

## How to use

Put the codes you want to Test inside the [./all_codes](https://github.com/Nimaj2002/Tester_Code/tree/main/all_codes) directory. Don't remember these are python files :)

Put all your inputs inside [./In](https://github.com/Nimaj2002/Tester_Code/tree/main/In) directory.  
input files should look like this:
>> input1.txt , input2.txt , input3.txt , ...

put all your outputs inside [./Out](https://github.com/Nimaj2002/Tester_Code/tree/main/Out) directory.              
Output files should also look like this:
>> output1.txt , output2.txt , output3.txt , ...

```bash
Don not Forget that input and output are in lowercase !!!
```

## Results
This Program will give you a TXT file inside [./results](https://github.com/Nimaj2002/Tester_Code/tree/main/results) for each file in [./all_codes](https://github.com/Nimaj2002/Tester_Code/tree/main/all_codes) directory.    
Showing the [PASSED] and [FAILED] tests and overall result at the ending of the files including Percentage for that tested program
